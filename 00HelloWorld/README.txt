TASK OVERVIEW
==============

In this task, you'll be introduced to the structure of tasks that we'll follow from now on. Each task contains a README.txt file that describes the purpose of that task and introduces core programming concepts.

  src    The source code for your application. Your code will go in app.js
         runApp.html is loaded in your web browser to execute your application

  tests  Tests that have been written to ensure that your src/app.js behaves 
         as expected. runTests.html is loaded in your web browser to execute
         the tests. If any tests fail, you'll need to write or update code
         in src/app.js in order to make them pass. You should reload 
         runTests.html each time you've updated your code to be sure that
         any passed tests are still passed and to work toward making all
         failed tests pass, too.
